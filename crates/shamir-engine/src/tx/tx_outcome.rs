/// is durable — but the projections that back that version (per-table data
/// → main, per-table index → info) may be only PARTIALLY applied across the
/// tables/indexes the tx touched. A single multi-table tx that defers can
/// leave table A's new rows materialized while table B's failed: a
/// concurrent reader opening a snapshot AFTER the publish sees A's new value
/// and B's OLD value AT THE SAME committed version — a genuine cross-table /
/// data-vs-index inconsistency. It is NOT reconciled online (there is no
/// background reconciler); it persists until the next `recover_v2_inflight`
/// (`RepoInstance::recover_v2_inflight`) on repo open replays the one
/// inflight WAL entry — which carries ALL the tx's ops, every table — and
/// converges every projection. What is still guaranteed even while
/// deferred: a single-key read via `MvccStore::get_at` is never byte-torn
/// (each key is whole-value last-write-wins), and the version floor is
/// monotonic. What lags: cross-table atomicity and data-vs-index agreement,
/// until recovery runs.
