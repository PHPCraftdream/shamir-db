//! Cold-start completion of an outstanding replication receipt (S5c-X
//! PR6b-2). Runs inside `reconcile_with_hook` BEFORE the PR6c classification
//! so a completed receipt's versions are certified through the bookmark's
//! clean horizon instead of being declared a recovery GAP.
//!
//! Idempotent: a no-op when the bookmark v3 record is absent or references
//! no outstanding receipt. Otherwise it drives the SAME atomic
//! Prepared → Materialized → checkpoint pipeline the warm resume path uses
//! (`receipt::stage` / `receipt::checkpoint`, including the Uncertain
//! read-back reconciles), minus guard publication — a cold start has no live
//! gate watermark obligation; the cold gate seeds from the persisted markers.
//! The checkpoint tail also runs the synchronous RAM publication
//! (`receipt::publish`) exactly like the warm path. Journal coverage is
//! verified (and repaired through the sole journal writer if an Uncertain
//! commit lost rows) before any bookmark advance, so any decode/IO failure
//! refuses the cold open, matching the PR4 policy.
//!
//! PR6b-3: native visibility is enabled by the CALLER's classification (a
//! valid v3 record is the only durable follower discriminator), so this
//! module only completes the receipt. The strict v3 read is used; an absent
//! record → `Ok(())`. Legacy records can no longer reach here: the cold open
//! was already refused by classification before this runs.
