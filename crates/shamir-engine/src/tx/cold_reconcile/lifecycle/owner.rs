//! Lifecycle owner: repository-owned structured worker lifecycle
//! (S5c-X PR6b-2b, supervisor-owned-join-handle design).
//!
//! Three objects make up the foundation: this owner, the worker execution
//! state ([`super::worker::WorkerExecutionState`]),
//! and the job envelope. The lifecycle is `Open -> Closing -> Joined`;
//! quarantine is unconditional (the parked-guard count is NEVER consulted).
//! Repository shutdown uses ONE absolute deadline for worker shutdown,
//! commit quiescence, flush, and checkpoint. Lifecycle shutdown itself waits
//! only for the worker terminal. Full contract:
//! `docs/guide-docs/follower-journal-durability.md`.
//!
//! The handle and lease `Arc` belong to a supervisor task. The supervisor
//! joins the worker, drops the lease (the last `Arc<L>`), sets
//! `supervisor_joined`, then publishes the terminal outcome into a `watch`
//! channel (first-write-wins). Dropping the owner therefore cannot detach
//! the worker, and the physical lease lifetime ends strictly after join.
//!
//! Contention model: admission and quarantine serialize acceptance with
//! `admission_gate` and take `control` second. Quarantine releases admission
//! before acquiring the publication interlock. Publication callbacks must not
//! re-enter lifecycle operations. No lifecycle lock is held across `.await`.
//! The worker has no sender reference. Protected resources must not be dropped from publication callbacks.
