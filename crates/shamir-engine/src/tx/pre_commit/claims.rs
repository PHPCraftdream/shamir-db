// ── F-48b (#867) test-only pause seam ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Mirrors F-46's `TEST_POST_VALIDATE_PRE_PUBLISH_HOOK` (commit.rs, #857),
// F-47's `TEST_POST_GENCHECK_PRE_PUBLISH_HOOK` (fk_reverse_cache.rs, #858),
// and F-48's `TEST_POST_BARRIER_PRE_WRITE_HOOK` (table_manager_crud.rs, #859):
// a `#[cfg(test)]` `OnceLock<Arc<Hook>>` global, zero cost when unset. The
// seam fires in `pre_commit_prelock` strictly AFTER Phase 2.5's
// `needs_write_barrier()` check has run for every table in `tx.write_set`
// (so the test knows which path each table took) and BEFORE Phase 5c's
// materialize write. A test installs the hook, spawns a tx commit,
// busy-polls `reached`, then drives a schema-activation DDL's
// raise+drain+count-proof while the tx is parked, then `resume`s it —
// deterministically reproducing the check-then-act interleaving the
// 2026-07-28 review's P0-3 finding describes for the tx-commit path.

/// Test-only pause/resume handshake installed via
/// [`TEST_POST_PRELOCK_PRE_MATERIALIZE_HOOK`]. `reached` lets the harness
/// detect (via polling, no sleeps) that the tx commit under test has
/// actually parked at the seam; `resume` is the release signal; `armed`
/// makes the pause one-shot (CAS true→false) so only the FIRST committer
/// to reach the seam parks — every later arrival (including the harness's
/// own concurrent DDL-side writer, if it also commits) passes straight
/// through. Shape mirrors `commit.rs::PostValidatePrePublishHook` (F-46)
/// and `table_manager_crud.rs::PostBarrierPreWriteHook` (F-48) exactly.
