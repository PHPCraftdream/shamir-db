//! Receipt worker on the merged lifecycle foundation (S5c-X PR6b-2c — the
//! two mandated replacements of the parent task: this file replaces the old
//! branch's OWN worker task and its wrapper admission with the repository's
//! `ForegroundLifecycle` + `RepoWriteDomain`).
//!
//! Worker = lifecycle foundation: `RepoInstance` owns ONE
//! `Arc<ForegroundLifecycle<ReceiptApplyJob, DbResult<ApplyOutcome>>>` (the
//! existing `worker_lifecycle` field, re-parameterized) plus a lazy
//! `receipt_worker` OnceCell holding the lease. The worker is installed on
//! the FIRST submit via `install_worker(lease, handler)`; `install_worker`
//! is the ONLY `tokio::spawn` in the receipt path. The job payload
//! ([`ReceiptApplyJob`]) carries an owned repo clone + the info store + the
//! events + bookmark + policy; the reply is `DbResult<ApplyOutcome>` via the
//! lifecycle's `LifecycleJob` envelope. The worker holds NO sender and NO
//! owner handle: repository drop drops the foreground token → `close()` →
//! the worker drains and the supervisor joins → the lease is dropped after
//! join, so `ReceiptLease::quarantine_parked_if_any` runs exactly once,
//! through the owner's supervisor.
//!
//! Admission = the repository permit: `run_receipt_pipeline` admits through
//! `write_domain().admit()` (or `admit_with_reservation` when the lease
//! carries a paused reservation) — never through a wrapper mutex.
//!
//! Guard ownership across errors (finding 2): a pipeline that fails while it
//! still holds fresh chunk `VersionGuard`s parks them in the lease instead
//! of dropping them — a dropped guard marks its version `Aborted` and
//! ADVANCES the watermarks, which would let the repo serve over an
//! unpublished version. Parked guards are released ONLY by (a) a later
//! successful publication on this repo (the versions are then ≤ the
//! watermark, so their eventual `Aborted` marks are no-ops), or (b) worker
//! shutdown under QUARANTINE: the gate is set `requires_reopen` and the
//! guards dropped (after reopen the `Aborted` marks are acceptable — the
//! repo is fail-stopped until then).
