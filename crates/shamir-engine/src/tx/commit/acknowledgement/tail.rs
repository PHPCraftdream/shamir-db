/// D2 P1e — soft async backpressure on the undrained version gap.
///
/// The gap is `gate.last_committed() - gate.durable_watermark()`: the number
/// of versions that are visible (published to readers via the overlay) but not
/// yet durable in `history` (the background [`Drainer`](crate::tx::drainer::Drainer)
/// has not replayed their WAL entries). Each undrained version pins an overlay
/// entry + an inflight WAL marker, so an unbounded gap is an unbounded RAM /
/// WAL-tail leak.
///
/// ## Contract
/// * **Fast path (zero overhead):** if `gap <= high` it returns immediately —
///   one pair of atomic loads, no allocation, no wake, no await. This is the
///   common case under any non-pathological load, so a steady committer pays
///   nothing.
/// * **Brake (only under pressure):** once `gap > high`, the committer wakes
///   the drainer and parks on the gate's durable-progress [`Notify`], re-checking
///   the gap each time the drain makes progress. It resumes the instant the gap
///   drops below the LOW watermark `high / 2` (hysteresis: braking to exactly
///   `high` would re-trigger on the very next commit and thrash; draining down
///   to `high/2` amortizes the brake over many commits).
///
/// ## Lost-wakeup safety
/// Each loop iteration registers `gate.durable_notified()` (a `Notified` future)
/// BEFORE re-reading the gap, then awaits it. A concurrent `mark_durable`
/// between the gap read and the await cannot be missed: `notify_waiters` wakes
/// every already-registered waiter, and the future was registered first. We
/// also re-wake the drainer each iteration so a drainer that went idle (its own
/// `notify_one` permit consumed) is nudged back to work.
///
/// ## Deadlock safety (the load-bearing guard)
/// The drainer can get STUCK — a durable-write error (disk full, backend fault)
/// leaves `durable_watermark` frozen, so the gap never closes and the parking
/// loop would wait forever. To make a stuck drain a DEGRADATION (more RAM) and
/// never a HANG, the loop is bounded by a wall-clock budget
/// ([`BACKPRESSURE_MAX_WAIT`]). When the budget is exhausted it logs a warning
/// and RETURNS (proceeds without backpressure). Correctness is untouched — the
/// data is already committed and observable; only the overlay-bounding promise
/// is relaxed under a faulted drain, which is the right trade (never wedge a
/// committer on a broken disk). Each individual park is itself capped by a short
/// `sleep` in the `select!` so a single lost signal cannot stall a whole budget.
///
/// Takes `high` as a parameter so tests can drive the state machine with a tiny
/// artificial gap; production callers pass [`MAX_UNDRAINED_VERSIONS`].
