/// that recovery replays idempotently (all-or-nothing materialization).
///
/// Why `std::process::abort()` and not `panic!`:
///   `panic!` UNWINDS the stack — it runs every `Drop` impl on the way
///   out, which would flush `MemBuffer`/`Cached` write-backs, drop
///   storage handles cleanly, and let `RAII` guards release. That is a
///   *graceful* shutdown, the exact opposite of a crash. `process::abort`
///   raises `SIGABRT` immediately: no unwind, no `Drop`, no flush — the
///   closest in-process analog to `kill -9`. The on-disk state left
///   behind is therefore a genuine torn-mid-commit image, which is what
///   the recovery contract must survive.
///
/// Durability of the on-disk image (the `repo` argument):
///   The crash is real, but for the recovery contract to be *meaningful*
///   the WAL entry written in Phase 4 (and the Phase-5 row writes for the
///   later seams) must already be on disk when the process dies. Several
///   backends — redb's `Store::set` among them — use a deferred-fsync
///   write mode where rows become crash-durable only on an explicit
///   `flush()` (or, in production, on the MemBuffer flush tick). To model
///   a backend whose WAL/data writes are *synchronously* durable (the
///   durability mode the recovery guarantee assumes), every seam AT or
///   AFTER the commit point flushes the repo's shared store before
///   aborting. Because all of a repo's stores (WAL `__tx__`, per-table
///   `__data__`/`__info__`) share one backend handle (e.g. one redb
///   `Database`), a single `flush()` makes the entire pending image
///   durable. This flush is NOT a graceful shutdown: it is `fsync`, not
///   `Drop` — no buffers are drained through destructors, no guards
///   release, no in-memory tx state is reconciled. The `pre_commit` seam
///   deliberately does NOT flush: it fires BEFORE the WAL entry exists,
///   so the disk must show nothing tx-related (clean abort).
///
/// Gating (zero cost in production):
///   The whole hook is `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`. In a normal
///   `--release` build `debug_assertions` is off, so `maybe_crash`
///   compiles to the empty `#[inline(always)]` twin below — dead code,
///   no env read, no branch, the `repo`/`phase` args unused. Tests build
///   in debug, where the hook is live but still a NO-OP unless
///   `SHAMIR_TEST_CRASH_AFTER` is set to a matching phase label. With no
///   env var present every existing test pays at most one `env::var` miss
///   per seam and never crashes or flushes.
///
/// Phase labels: `pre_commit`, `phase4`, `phase5a`, `phase5c`,
/// `phase5d_delta` (#426 VR-4 — after the pre-publish delta-chunk append,
/// before publish; proves the durable delta survives a crash and
/// `restore_on_open` replays it), `phase5d_delta_async` (the AsyncIndex
/// twin), `phase6`, `phase6_5`, `phase7`. D4 drain seam (fired from the drainer's per-entry
/// loop, not the ack-path): `drain_replay` — AFTER `replay_v2_entry` made the

/// idempotently. F6c truncation seams (fired from the drainer, not the

/// Inline panics propagate without restarting the future; detached panics
/// are logged and existing VersionGuard orphan recovery remains the fallback.
/// Shutdown must stop admission and quiesce commits before stopping Tokio.

/// Thin metrics-only wrapper around `commit_tx_inner`: it records the
/// `on_tx_aborted_storage` metric on a PRE-commit storage abort and is

///
/// Metric semantics shift (Vector I.3 / MED-A): post-Phase-4 storage
/// failures no longer surface as `Err(TxError::Storage)` aborts — they
/// become `Ok(TxOutcome { materialization: Deferred, .. })`. So every
/// `Err(TxError::Storage)` reaching this wrapper is by construction a
/// PRE-commit abort, and `on_tx_aborted_storage` correctly counts only
/// those. Deferred materialization is observable three ways:
/// `TxOutcome::materialization`, the `log::warn!` emitted in `materialize`,
/// and the `TxMetrics::txs_materialization_deferred` counter
/// (`on_tx_materialization_deferred`, fired in `commit_tx_inner` when
/// `materialize` returns `Deferred`).
///
/// There is NOTHING to do for HNSW staging on a pre-commit abort —
/// staged vectors live inside the `TxContext` (`staged_vectors`) and
