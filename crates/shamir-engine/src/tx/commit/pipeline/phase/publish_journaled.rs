/// Publish only at the point of no return, after WAL success and the last
/// crash/failure exit. No event is ever enqueued for a version that never
/// publishes: preparation alone has no journal/gap side effect, and this
/// synchronous enqueue-or-gap + commit pair has no await or fallible step
/// between them. Cancellation cannot split the pair. Closed marks a gap in
/// `journal_enqueue`; Full defers the event into the repair-pending set
/// (`repair_pending`) and the drainer's `drain_repair_pending` lands it on a
/// later pass. Failed initialization records its gap here, not at
/// preparation time. The returned Arc is the SAME allocation used by the
/// channel and later live broadcast (one allocation, as in the old emit).
