//! F-48b (#867, P0) — tx-commit-path writer-drain barrier proof.
//!
//! Sibling of `crate::table::tests::schema_activation_barrier_tests.rs`'s
//! F-48 drain test (`f48_drain_catches_writer_that_read_false_before_flag_went_up`).
//! That test proved the drain closes the check-then-act race for the NON-tx
//! `TableManager::insert` path. This test proves the SAME drain closes the
//! identical race for the TX-COMMIT path (`pre_commit.rs::pre_commit_prelock`
//! Phase 2.5 → `materialize` Phase 5c) — the path essentially ALL production
//! client writes actually take.
//!
//! ## The gap (pre-F-48b)
//!
//! `pre_commit_prelock`'s Phase 2.5 reads `needs_write_barrier()` ONCE per
//! table in `tx.write_set`; if `false` at that moment, the table's token never
//! enters `unique_tokens`, so `unique_write_lock` is never taken for it, and
//! the transaction's ACTUAL data write (Phase 5c `materialize`) proceeds with
//! no further check. A schema-activation DDL that raises the barrier AFTER
//! this check (and calls `drain_writers()`) sees zero in-flight writers
//! (incorrectly, since this tx never entered the drain set), reads
//! `count() == 0`, and stamps `keyset_safe = true`. Then this tx's write
//! lands, violating the just-stamped proof.
//!
//! ## The fix (F-48b)
//!
//! For every table in `tx.write_set`, enter the drain set BEFORE reading
//! `needs_write_barrier()`. If the flag is `true` (slow path: gets a
//! `unique_write_lock` guard), drop the drain guard immediately (avoids
//! deadlock — the lock alone provides exclusion). If `false`, keep the drain
//! guard alive until Phase 5c materialize lands — so a DDL that raises the
//! barrier AFTER this check genuinely waits for this tx to finish.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! Same established Notify-handshake style as F-46/F-47/F-48: a `#[cfg(test)]`
//! `OnceLock<Arc<Hook>>` seam in `pre_commit.rs` parks the tx's commit task
//! strictly AFTER Phase 2.5's flag-check and BEFORE Phase 5c's materialize
//! write. The harness busy-polls `reached` (no sleeps) to detect the park,
//! drives the DDL's raise+lock+drain+count-proof while parked, then releases
//! the tx. On the UNFIXED code the DDL's count-proof reads 0 (race); on the
//! FIXED code the drain blocks until the tx finishes, so the count-proof sees
//! the in-flight writer's row.

// ============================================================================
// THE F-48b PROOF — a tx whose Phase 2.5 reads needs_write_barrier()==false
// for a table parks strictly after that check and before its Phase 5c
// materialize write. While parked, a schema-activation DDL raises the
// barrier, takes unique_write_lock, calls drain_writers(), and reads its
// count-proof.
//
// - UNFIXED code: the tx never entered the drain set, so `drain_writers()`
//   returns immediately (counter == 0); count reads 0 while the tx is still
//   parked; the tx's write then lands → keyset_safe proof violated.
// - FIXED code: the tx entered the drain set before reading the flag, so
//   `drain_writers()` blocks until the tx finishes; the count-proof sees the
