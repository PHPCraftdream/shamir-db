//! D2 P1e — overlay-GC bound + commit-path soft backpressure.
//!
//! Two halves, both pinning the P1e contract that the in-memory overlay is
//! bounded to the still-undrained `(durable_watermark, last_committed]` window:
//!
//!   A. **Overlay GC.** After a real `commit_tx` burst the overlay holds one
//!      entry per committed version (the ack-path published only the overlay,
//!      not `history`). A `drain_all` pass advances `durable_watermark` to
//!      `last_committed`, and the drainer's post-pass `gc_overlay_to` sweep
//!      then drops every overlay entry `<= durable_watermark` — so the overlay
//!      (and the `pending_ts` commit-stamp map) collapse to ~0 while every
//!      value still reads back (now served by `history`). A multi-round loop
//!      proves the overlay does not grow without bound across many
//!      commit-then-drain cycles.
//!
//!   B. **Backpressure.** [`apply_backpressure`](crate::tx::commit::apply_backpressure)
//!      is driven directly with a tiny artificial threshold so the state
//!      machine is exercised deterministically without needing 10 000 real
//!      commits:
//!        * gap <= high  → returns IMMEDIATELY (fast path, zero await).
//!        * gap >  high  → parks on durable progress, then RELEASES once a
//!          concurrent drain pulls the gap below the low-watermark (`high/2`).
//!        * stuck drain  → the wall-clock deadlock guard ABANDONS the brake and
//!          PROCEEDS (never hangs the committer on a faulted disk).
//!
//! All tests run on the `current_thread` runtime so the repo's spawned
//! background drainer can only progress at the `.await` points the test
//! controls — the watermark reads between a commit and a synchronous assertion
//! are therefore deterministic.
