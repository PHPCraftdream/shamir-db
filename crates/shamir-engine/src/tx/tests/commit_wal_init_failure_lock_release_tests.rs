//! Group 15 (2026-08-14 cross-crate review, SUMMARY.md 6.2 /
//! error-handling-lifecycle.md #2) regression: `commit_tx_inner`'s
//! `tx_gate()` / `repo_wal()` resolution must release Level-3 pessimistic
//! locks before propagating an `Err`, exactly like every other early-exit
//! path in that function. Pre-fix, `let wal = repo.repo_wal().await?;`
//! propagated the `?` directly — no `release_pessimistic_locks` call — so
//! a Pessimistic tx whose commit hit a `repo_wal()` I/O failure (its first
//! WAL touch for the repo) leaked `locked_keys` permanently, and a younger
//! waiter parked in `lock_key` (no timeout) would hang forever.
//!
//! Fault injection needs NO test-only seam: `RepoInstance::repo_wal()`
//! lazily does a REAL `std::fs::create_dir_all` on the WAL sibling
//! directory (`<repo_dir>.shamirwal`) on first touch. Placing a plain FILE
//! at that exact path before the repo ever resolves its WAL makes
//! `create_dir_all` fail with a genuine "already exists / not a directory"
//! disk error — the exact class of fault the audit describes — with zero
//! production-code changes required to trigger it.
