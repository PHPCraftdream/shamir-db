//! S5c-X PR5b part 2 — the channel-full journal repair drainer.
//!
//! When a changefeed event hits a full journal channel, `shamir-tx` records
//! its `commit_version` in `RepairPending` (no gap, no drop). This module is
//! the engine-side drainer that lands those deferred events on later drain
//! passes:
//!
//! 1. Derive the event again from the surviving WAL entry (the WAL segment is
//!    held retained by the `settle_and_truncate` repair-pending clamp for
//!    exactly this purpose).
//! 2. Probe the journal store first: an already-present equal event retires
//!    the version WITHOUT a repair credit (idempotence — the event was never
//!    repaired by us); a DIFFERING event is a loud `repair_mismatch` and is
//!    never overwritten and never declared a gap (the journal HAS an event).
//! 3. Otherwise `journal_enqueue_tracked` the derived event: admitted →
//!    `on_admitted`; Full → leave pending for the next pass; Closed → the
//!    gap was already marked and the version retired in-band.
//!
//! Cost model: the fast path is one atomic depth load per drainer pass. The
//! full retained-WAL scan (`replay()`) runs only when the pending set is
//! non-empty — the accepted rare-path cost, since a full channel is by
//! definition an exceptional backpressure event.
