//! Receipt identity verification (S5c-X PR6b-2c, review finding 1c): before
//! ANY resume work touches the repo, prove the outstanding receipt still
//! describes EXACTLY the batch the pull offers — same lineage/epoch, same
//! upstream coverage, same field bindings, and byte-identical downstream
//! translations. A mismatch means the durable receipt was produced from
//! different input than this pull claims; allocating replacement versions
//! on top of it could double-apply or silently diverge, so the pull is
//! REFUSED (the receipt stays; `DbError::Storage`).
//!
//! Failure-matrix row 1: the rejected re-translation below may have touched
//! the interner (first-touch of a field name inserts a monotonic-unused
//! id). That is SAFE with no rollback — unused monotonic ids are invisible
//! to reads and get reused by the next genuine first-touch of that name.

/// Full four-part identity check between an outstanding receipt and the
/// events the current pull offers:
///
/// (i) the current fence `lineage_id`/`history_epoch` must equal the
///     receipt's (a re-fence or epoch bump invalidates every receipt from
///     the previous history);
/// (ii) every receipt-mapped upstream version must be offered by this pull
///     (the old `match_offered` check — replacements must never be
///     allocated on top of the receipt's local versions);
/// (iii) the union of the offered events' `field_bindings` for the covered
///     versions must equal `receipt.bindings` (id→name pairs) — the leader
///     must not have renamed a field between the original apply and now;
/// (iv) BYTE identity: for each covered version, re-translate the offered
///     event exactly like `apply_fresh` does (`prepare_event` with
///     `applied_watermark = receipt.predecessor_bookmark`), reproject with
///     the receipt's local version, serialize, and compare against
///     `receipt.downstream_events[index]`.
///
/// (i)+(ii) are cheap and run before the resume arm loads bookmark v3;
/// (iii)+(iv) run in the same entry so tests can target the whole check
/// with one call. Every mismatch fails with `DbError::Storage` and the
/// message below — the receipt remains outstanding and the pull is refused.
