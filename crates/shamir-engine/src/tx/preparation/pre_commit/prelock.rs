/// - Phase 1: interner overlay merge + remap (CAS-safe on DashMap).
/// - Phase 2.5: acquire per-table `unique_write_lock` guards in sorted
///   token order, for every table with a unique guard OR (#538 Part A) an

/// - Phase 2.6: authoritative unique re-validation under the uwl_guards.
///   Decisive because the uwl_guard excludes both non-tx writers and other

///   is held continuously through Phase 5c (inside `materialize`), so no
///   writer can interleave between this check and the posting write.
///
/// Lock ordering / ABBA-freedom (§B9, updated for Stage B):
///   - uwl_guards are acquired BEFORE `commit_lock`. A non-tx writer holds
///     at most ONE uwl and NEVER waits on `commit_lock`. Two committers
///     touching overlapping unique tables serialize on the uwl_guards (sorted
///     token order — no ABBA between committers). The `commit_lock` is then
///     acquired by whichever committer holds its uwl_guards; since
///     `commit_lock` is a single global mutex, no ordering cycle is possible:
///     all committers acquire uwl_guards first, then `commit_lock`.
///     Therefore no ABBA cycle is possible.

/// cancel-safe: YES for Phase 1 (CAS-based, no durable mutation). Phase 2.5

    //
    // The problem this closes: non-tx `insert` / `set` / `delete` take a
    // DIFFERENT mutex — the per-table `unique_write_lock` — and never touch
    // `commit_lock`. So without this step a non-tx unique write could claim
    // or overwrite the same unique posting in the window between this tx's
    // Phase 2.6 re-check and its Phase 5c posting write, producing a
    // duplicate unique value + corrupted index. Acquiring the same per-table
    // lock the non-tx path uses makes the tx's "check unique key free →
    // write posting" atomic against every non-tx unique writer to that table.
    //
    // Two concurrent committers touching the same unique-constrained table
    // serialize on the same uwl_guard (sorted token order prevents ABBA).
    // The loser waits here until the winner's Phase 5c completes and drops
    // the guard — at that point the loser's Phase 2.6 re-check sees the
    // winner's posting and correctly detects the conflict.
    //
    // #538 Part A: the token set was originally built ONLY from
    // `tx.unique_guards` (tables with a base_index UNIQUE index) — an
    // index2-only table (fts/functional/vector, no base_index unique index)
    // contributed nothing, so this tx's Phase 5a/5c could freely interleave
    // with a concurrent `create_index_v2`'s backfill on that table (the same
    // lost-write window #534 closed for the non-tx path, left open here).
    // Fixed by additionally scanning every table this tx actually staged a
    // write to (`tx.write_set` keys) and including its token whenever
    // `TableManager::needs_write_barrier()` is `true` — which is exactly the
    // predicate the non-tx writer methods gate on, so a table with an
    // in-flight `create_index_v2` (index2_create_barrier up) now serializes
    // its tx-commit materialization against that create too, via the SAME
    // `unique_write_lock` `create_index_v2` holds for its full backfill
    // duration. This does NOT close #538's Part B: the index2 ops-PLAN
    // (`tx.index_write_set`) was already captured at STAGE time against an
    // `all_backends()` snapshot, well before this prelock runs — see
    // `TableManager::backfill_index2_backend`'s doc comment for the full
    // accounting.
    //
    // `table_by_token_if_live` (NOT `table_by_token`) resolves the table
    // WITHOUT forcing lazy instantiation: a table that was `add_table`d but
    // never actually accessed via `get_table` stays dormant. This matters —
    // instantiating a `TableManager` as a side effect of merely checking a
    // barrier flag would register it in `per_table_mvcc`, changing
    // `apply_data_batch`'s routing for that table from the direct-store
    // fallback to MVCC-routed, a behavior change this check must not cause.
    // It is also correct: `needs_write_barrier()` can only be `true` on an
    // instance that was actually created (no code path can flip
    // `index2_create_barrier` or register a base_index unique index without
    // first holding a live `TableManager`), so a dormant table is
    // equivalent to "no barrier" for this purpose.
    //
    // We use `lock_owned()` so the guards can be collected into a `Vec`
    // without borrow-lifetime entanglement (each `OwnedMutexGuard` owns its
    // `Arc<Mutex<()>>`). Tables needing neither a unique guard nor the
    // index2-create barrier are untouched — the lock-free fast path is
    // preserved for them.
    //
    // F-48b (#867): the lock-free fast path has the SAME check-then-act race
    // F-48 closed for the non-tx writer methods — `needs_write_barrier()` is
    // read ONCE, and if `false` the tx proceeds through Phase 5c materialize
    // with no further check, so a DDL raising the barrier AFTER this read (and
    // calling `drain_writers()`) sees zero in-flight writers, incorrectly.
    // Fixed by entering the writer-drain set (`enter_writer_drain`) BEFORE
    // reading the flag, for every table in `tx.write_set` — the cross-atomic
    // happens-before edge to the DDL's drain load is carried by the single

    // in the drain set while blocking on the lock (held by a DDL that is
    // itself calling `drain_writers()`) would deadlock. If `false`, keep the

    // #1039 / #1074 — Intra-tx unique dedup + cross-tx re-validation.
    //
    // #1039 added an intra-tx dedup pass over `tx.unique_guards`. But
    // `unique_guards` is a chronological list of point-in-time CLAIMS — DELETE
    // never pushes a guard, and an UPDATE that moves a record OFF a unique key
    // pushes no "release" marker for the old key either. So #1039's check
    // treated the FIRST owner seen for a key as authoritative and
    // false-rejected any later guard with a different owner, even when the
    // first owner had legitimately vacated that key earlier in the same tx
    // (via UPDATE-off or DELETE) — a legal pattern that committed fine before
    // #1039 (#1074 regression).
    //
    // #1074 fix: use `tx.index_write_set` — the authoritative ordered storage
    // mutation sequence — for the intra-tx conflict detection. `RemovePosting`
    // (emitted by `plan_record_updated_unique` / `plan_record_deleted_unique`
    // when a record moves off or is deleted from a unique key) IS the release
    // marker that `unique_guards` lacks. Walking the unique-family ops in
    // staging order and tracking live ownership per key gives the TRUE final
    // per-key state:
    //   - SetPosting on a key whose current live owner is a DIFFERENT record →
    //     genuine intra-tx collision (no release between them) → abort.
    //   - RemovePosting releases the key, so a LATER SetPosting from a
    //     different record is a legitimate release-then-reclaim, not a conflict.
    //
    // `tx.unique_guards` is still iterated for the durable-state (cross-tx)
    // check, because an update re-writing the SAME unique value produces NO
    // SetPosting (plan_record_updated_unique is a no-op when old_key == new_key)
    // but DOES push a guard — that key still needs committed-state validation.
    // For keys in the write-set walk, the FINAL owner from the walk is used
    // (may differ from the guard's owner if the key was released and reclaimed);
    //
    // **#1096 closes the "release-then-reclaim a DURABLE (prior-tx) unique
    // value within one tx" scenario** (found not fully covered by #1074 in
    // an @oh review, 2026-08-11): `tx1: INSERT A {email:"x"}; COMMIT` then
    // `tx2: DELETE A; INSERT B {email:"x"}`. Two call sites needed fixing,
    // one per copy of the durable-only assumption:
    //   - `table_manager_tx_ops.rs::insert_tx`'s stage-time
    //     `validate_unique_for_create` (read-only against committed state)
    //     now takes `released_unique_keys_in_tx` (this same live/released
    //     walk, run at stage time against only the value's own claimed
    //     keys) so it no longer synchronously rejects `INSERT B` with
    //     `DuplicateKey` before it is ever staged into
    //     `tx.index_write_set`.
    //   - THIS function's Step 2 durable check (below) independently made
    //     the same durable-only assumption: even after `INSERT B` reaches
    //     staging, `info_store.get(index_key)` still returns `A` (Phase 5c's
    //     materialize write, which would remove `A`'s posting, hasn't run
    //     yet — pre_commit validates BEFORE that write). Step 2 now
    //     tolerates a durable-owner mismatch when the key is in
    //     `ever_released` — this tx's own `index_write_set` staged a
    //     `RemovePosting` for that exact key earlier, so the stale durable
    //     owner is provably the record being released, not an unrelated
    //     conflict.
    // for keys NOT in the write set (self-write), the guard's owner stands.
    //
    // Why option (a) / naive overwrite on `unique_guards` is insufficient: it
    // has no release markers, so it cannot distinguish "A moved off K before B
    // claimed it" from "A never moved off K and B is a genuine duplicate" —
    // the former must commit, the latter must abort, but both produce the same
    // claims-only guard sequence [(K, A), (K, B)].

    // Step 1 — Walk unique-family ops in index_write_set in staging order to
    // detect intra-tx conflicts and determine the final live owner per key.
    // `live`: (table_token, index_key) → record CURRENTLY owning it as of the
    // op being processed.  `released`: keys vacated by a RemovePosting so the
    // guard loop (step 2) can distinguish "released" from "never in write set".
    // `ever_released`: the union of every key that had AT LEAST ONE
    // RemovePosting during the walk, whether or not it was later reclaimed —
    // #1096: Step 2's durable check needs this (not just the final-state
    // `released`) to recognize a release-then-reclaim-within-this-tx of a
    // key whose PRIOR owner is DURABLE (committed by an earlier tx), where

    // F-50 (#869, spike) — Phase 2.7: re-derive index2 posting ops for any
    // backend registered AFTER this tx's stage-time `all_backends()` snapshot.
    //
    // This closes #538 Part B's "guaranteed miss": a tx that staged before a
    // new index2 backend existed (via `create_index_v2`) and commits after it
    // was registered would otherwise carry zero ops for it in
    // `tx.index_write_set` (planned stale, at stage time), so Phase 5c would
    // have nothing to write — the row is permanently absent from the new
    // index. Part A's commit-time lock serialization (Phase 2.5 above) only
    // fixed the commit's TIMING; it cannot retroactively add ops to an
    // already-built plan.
    //
    // Placement is load-bearing for crash safety:
    //   - AFTER Phase 2.5's per-table `unique_write_lock` acquisition, so any
    //     in-flight `create_index_v2` (which holds that lock across its full
    //     backfill→register sequence) has finished registering by the time we
    //     re-derive — the live `backends_newer_than(stage_gen)` snapshot we
    //     take here includes it.
    //   - BEFORE Phase 4's WAL `begin_grouped` (which runs later, inside
    //     `pre_commit_locked_validate`): `wal_ops_from_tx` serializes
    //     `tx.index_write_set` directly into the WAL entry, so the re-derived
    //     ops MUST be appended before that serialization or recovery would
    //     replay the STALE stage-time plan (silently re-opening the exact miss
    //     this step closes). Re-deriving AFTER the WAL write is forbidden.
    //   - OUTSIDE `commit_lock` (this whole fn runs pre-lock): the work is
    //     per-table, async, and has no commit-window dependency, so holding
    //     the global commit_lock for it would be needless contention.
    //
    // The generation gate makes this zero-cost on the common path: a tx that
    // captured `index2_stage_gens` (populated only by index2-bearing-table
    // staging) and sees an unchanged generation skips the per-record
    // re-derivation entirely. See `rederive_index2_ops_post_stage` for the
    // old-value resolution (insert-vs-update-vs-delete) mechanism.
