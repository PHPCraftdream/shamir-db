// ===========================================================================
// Phase B — interactive (multi-call) transactions
//
// Phase A's `execute_transactional` opens a tx, runs ONE batch's plan, and
// commits — all inside a single call. Phase B factors that closed cycle into
// three reusable pieces so a `TxContext` can be parked server-side (the
// interactive-tx registry) and driven across multiple client round-trips:
//
//   * `open_interactive_tx`   — BEGIN: mint the tx + snapshot guard.
//   * `execute_in_open_tx`    — EXECUTE: run one batch's plan against the
//                               EXISTING tx, NO commit (the tx stays open).
//   * `commit_interactive_tx` — COMMIT: run the Phase-A commit pipeline.
//
// ROLLBACK needs no function — dropping the parked `TxContext` is the RAII
// rollback (no storage side effects). See
// `docs/dev-artifacts/roadmap/PHASE_B_INTERACTIVE_TX.md` §5. These are thin wrappers: no
// new execution logic. `execute_in_open_tx` mirrors `execute_batch`
// (plan → validate → run → filter) but routes through `execute_plan_tx`
// with the caller's `&mut TxContext` and returns `transaction: None` because
// the tx is still open — the commit outcome is produced later by
// `commit_interactive_tx`.
// ===========================================================================

/// BEGIN an interactive transaction: open the MVCC snapshot and mint the
/// `TxContext`.

/// later by [`commit_interactive_tx`]).
///
/// The single-repo guard is enforced here exactly as in [`execute_batch`];
/// the caller additionally asserts that the batch targets the SAME repo the
/// handle is pinned to (the engine tx is committed against one repo).
///
/// Each call has a cooperative `max_execution_time_secs` budget, just like
/// `execute_batch` (30 seconds by default). This replaces the former
/// multi-roundtrip rationale for unbounded execution: a per-call bound is
/// safe because execution returns an ordinary `ExecutionTimedOut` error,
/// without cancelling a future or committing the transaction. The tx stays
/// open; the caller must roll it back/drop it on timeout, including any
/// writes staged by earlier calls. Existing safe execution checkpoints
/// enforce the bound; they do not preempt a stalled operation.
/// The transaction's lifetime across calls is a different budget, owned by
/// the caller, not this per-call deadline. Commit/WAL are not timed here.

/// Takes an [`Authorized`] token, not a raw `&BatchRequest` + `Actor` pair
/// (#1199) — see [`execute_batch`]'s doc and `authorized.rs`'s module doc.
