//! Lock-free index registry.
//!
//! Uses `scc::HashMap` (CAS-based) for both `id → backend` and
//! `name_interned → id` lookups. `next_id` is an `AtomicU32` —
//! `fetch_add(Relaxed)` is enough for unique-id generation since the
//! counter is single-source (no cross-process coordination).
//!
//! F-50 (#869, spike): `generation` is a monotonic `AtomicU64` bumped on
//! every successful `insert` / `remove_by_id`. It lets a tx cheaply detect
//! "an index2 backend was registered between my stage-time `all_backends()`
//! snapshot and my commit" without storing the full snapshot — capture the
//! generation once at stage, compare at commit. Each `by_id` entry also
//! records the generation at which THAT backend was inserted, so a commit
//! can ask for exactly the backends newer than its stage-time generation
//! (`backends_newer_than`) and re-derive posting ops for just those — never
//! re-planning (and thus never double-counting `BumpFtsStats` for) backends
//! the tx already planned against at stage time.
//!
//! R0-A (#1006): `insert()`'s per-entry tag and the published watermark are
//! the SAME counter (`generation.fetch_add(1, Release) + 1`) — see
//! [`IndexRegistry::insert`] for why a decoupled ticket counter (the P1/#992
//! design this replaces) is no longer needed now that every registry-
//! mutating DDL op (CREATE/DROP/RENAME across all four index families) holds
//! `TableManager::ddl_admission` for its ENTIRE critical section, INCLUDING
//! the `insert`/`remove_by_id` call and the generation bump
//! (`crates/shamir-engine/src/table/table_manager.rs`'s `begin_write_barrier`
//! — see that method's doc and R0-A's brief,
//! `docs/dev-artifacts/prompts/ddl-lifecycle/03-registry-watermark-and-full-admission.md`,
//! for the full derivation). With at most one registry mutation ever in
//! flight per table, a single monotonic counter can serve both roles without
//! reintroducing the read-then-write race `insert_ticket` was built to avoid.
