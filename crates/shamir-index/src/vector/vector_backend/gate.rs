//! Writer admission gate for compaction cutover (RV-INDEX-9F62C8DF).
//!
//! Every online mutation takes a [`WriteLease`] BEFORE touching the live
//! adapter and holds it across BOTH the primary write and the compaction
//! mirror. The coordinator seals the gate and waits on `drained` before
//! re-publishing a slot, so a publication never invalidates an in-flight
//! write and a failed mirror can never strand a completed primary write on
//! an unpublishable target.
