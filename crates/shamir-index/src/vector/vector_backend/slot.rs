//! Routing slot: ONE atomic publication unit (RV-INDEX-9F62C8DF).
//!
//! `ArcSwap<Arc<AdapterSlot>>` on `VectorBackend` is the single control
//! word. Writers admit against a slot (primary adapter + optional mirror
//! target + gate) with one RCU load; the coordinator re-publishes whole
//! slots via CAS. This replaces the old separate `adapter` + `ArcSwapOption`
//! `compaction_target` pair whose independently-sampled loads were the
//! check-then-publish race.
