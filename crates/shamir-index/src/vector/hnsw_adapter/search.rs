// #424 (Б-4) — test-only hook for deterministically reproducing the
// transient-None race window in `search`/`search_cofilter`.
//
// The race is between `quantized_active()` (Acquire load) and
// `hnsw.load_full()` (ArcSwap load) — two atomic reads with NO `.await`
// between them in the f32-graph branch. Under normal execution the window
// is a few nanoseconds of synchronous code; a statistical test cannot
// reliably hit it (confirmed: 3× consecutive runs of a tight-loop
// concurrent test passed even with the fix disabled).
//
// This hook lets a test PAUSE a search request at exactly the point where
// the race lives — AFTER `quantized_active() == false` has been read (so
// the request is committed to the f32 branch) but BEFORE
// `hnsw.load_full()`. The test then triggers a fit transition (which
// drops the f32 graph), confirms the drop, and releases the paused
// request — which now observes `load_full() == None` and must exercise the
// retry path.
//
// The hook carries TWO pieces of state:
//  * `arrived` — set by the search request when it REACHES the gate (so
//    the test knows the request is past the `quantized_active()` check and
//    is now paused inside the f32 branch).
//  * `notify` — the pause/release mechanism. The search request awaits
//    `notify.notified()`; the test calls `notify.notify_one()` to release
//    it after confirming the f32 graph has been dropped.
//
// `ArcSwapOption` so tests can install/clear it freely. Compiles away
// entirely in release builds (`#[cfg(test)]`).
