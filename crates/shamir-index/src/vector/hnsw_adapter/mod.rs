//! HNSW approximate nearest neighbor adapter using `hnsw_rs`.
//!
//! Concurrent `insert` calls are safe only with the workspace's vendored
//! `hnsw_rs` (`vendor/hnsw_rs`) lock-order fix; see its `VENDORED.md`.
//! We wrap that patched graph directly — no actor needed for HNSW itself.
//!
//! Deletion via soft-delete tombstone set; search over-scans ×2 to
//! compensate for filtered-out tombstones.
