//! rv_index_7bb73da5 / rv_index_da21c946 — threshold-crossing upsert must
//! NOT await the background fit.
//!
//! `upsert`/`upsert_batch` trigger a DEFERRED fit (`schedule_fit`) once the
//! live count crosses [`FIT_THRESHOLD`] (256); the upsert caller must return
//! immediately while the fit runs in the background. A regression that made
//! the upsert path await the fit inline would stall ingest for the whole
//! (expensive) quantizer-fit + u8-graph build.
//!
//! Oracle: the fit-side test hook (`install_fit_test_hook`). The fit task
//! parks at the hook gate (`hook.entered` / `hook.release`) right after
//! snapshotting and BEFORE any fit work. The test parks the fit there and
//! JOINs the upsert task with a timeout: since the fit stays parked until
//! AFTER the join, any upsert that awaited the fit inline would keep the
//! join from completing and the timeout fires deterministically (no
//! racy `is_finished()` polling).
