//! RV-INDEX-DA21C946 — fit-failure phase diagnostics.
//!
//! `schedule_fit` reports failures through the SINGLE production reporting
//! path, `HnswAdapter::report_fit_failure`: it emits the `log::error!` line
//! and — in test builds — records the diagnosed phase (`recorded_failure`
//! on the fit-test hook). Because both the log line and the recorder live
//! in that one function, deleting the `report_fit_failure` call in the
//! scheduler leaves `recorded_failure` as `None` and the tests below fail.
//! NOT covered: the exact `log::error!` output text/format — the log sink
//! itself is not captured.
//!
//! The tests assert the recorded phase matches the injected failure:
//!  * **before publication** (`fail_before_publish`): the fit task returns
//!    `Err` before any u8 graph is installed — the adapter stays on the f32
//!    brute-force path, searches keep working, and the single-flight flag is
//!    cleared so a future threshold crossing can re-arm a fit (proven by the
//!    re-arm section of the prefit test: a further upsert schedules and
//!    completes a SECOND fit).
//!  * **after publication** (`fail_after_publish`): the u8 graph was ALREADY
//!    published (`is_quantized() == true`) when the task failed — readers
//!    keep using the published quantized graph.
