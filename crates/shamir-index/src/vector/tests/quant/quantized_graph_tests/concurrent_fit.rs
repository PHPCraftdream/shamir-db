// =========================================================================
// #423 (Б-3, adversarial-review finding) — regression: tombstoning a
// pre-flip internal DURING the fit transition must NOT hang the catch-up
// loop forever.
//
// An earlier version of this fix computed `target = next_id_at_flip -
// deleted_count_at_flip` (a FROZEN snapshot of the deleted count taken at
// flip time). A pre-flip internal tombstoned AFTER the flip (a concurrent
// `delete`/rid-replacing `upsert` racing the fit) was never counted in the
// frozen `deleted_count_at_flip`, was skipped by the catch-up scan
// (`deleted.contains` guard), and so could never bump `migrated_pre_flip`
// to reach the frozen target — the catch-up loop would spin
// (`yield_now().await`) forever, hanging `try_fit_and_rebuild` and every
// upsert future waiting on the fit.
//
// The fix folds tombstones into `migrated_pre_flip` directly (see
// `bump_migrated_on_tombstone`), so a post-flip tombstone of a pre-flip
// internal advances convergence exactly like a claim would. This test
// races upserts that both cross the fit threshold AND repeatedly replace
// the SAME rid (tombstoning the previous internal on every replace) —
// reproducing the exact interleaving the adversarial review identified —
// and asserts the whole operation completes within a generous timeout.
// Before the fix this test would hang (timeout) instead of failing fast.

//
// The first tombstone-during-fit fix (bump_migrated_on_tombstone) closed
// the frozen-target hang, but introduced a narrower gap: the self-migration
// re-check in `upsert`/`upsert_batch` claimed a JUST-tombstoned internal
// (from a concurrent racer replacing the SAME rid) into `vectors_u8`
// WITHOUT checking `deleted.contains` first — unlike the three scan-based
// claim sites (fit snapshot, delta, catch-up loop), which all guard on it.
// This let `migrated_pre_flip` be bumped TWICE for one internal: once by
// the tombstone, once by the (incorrect) claim — an over-count that can
// trip the catch-up loop's convergence early, dropping the f32 graph while
// a genuinely still-in-flight, distinct pre-flip internal has not yet
// landed (the exact class of bug the Б-3 fix exists to prevent).
//
// This test drives the SPECIFIC interleaving the prior regression test
// (`concurrent_upsert_with_tombstone_across_fit_does_not_hang`) does not
// cover: tasks race `upsert` on OVERLAPPING/shared rids (not disjoint
// per-task ranges), so one task's freshly-allocated internal can be
// tombstoned by ANOTHER task's concurrent replace on the SAME rid while
// the first task's own self-migration re-check is still in flight. We
// cannot directly assert `migrated_pre_flip` (private), so we assert the
// deterministic node-count invariant from Б-1 — `get_nb_map() ==
// live count` — which a premature f32-graph-drop (induced by an
// over-counted convergence target) would violate by racing a genuine
// pre-flip vector out of both `vectors` and `vectors_u8`/the graph.

// =========================================================================
// #424 (Б-4) — regression: a search that reads `quantized_active() == false`
// (pre-flip) and THEN does `hnsw.load_full()` must NOT silently get an empty
// result when a fit transition drops the f32 graph between those two reads.
//
// The race window:
//   1. search reads `quantized_active()` → false (pre-flip) → f32 branch.
//   2. fitter: `is_fitted.store(true, Release)` + catch-up + `hnsw.store(None)`.
//   3. search: `hnsw.load_full()` → None.
//
// Before the fix, `search`/`search_cofilter` returned `Ok(vec![])` on None.
//
// The window is a few nanoseconds of synchronous code (no `.await` between
// the two reads), so a statistical concurrent test CANNOT reliably reproduce
// it (confirmed: 3× consecutive runs of a tight-loop test passed even with
// the fix disabled). Instead we use a deterministic test-only hook
// (`install_test_search_f32_gate`) that PAUSES a search request at exactly
// the race point — after `quantized_active() == false`, before
// `load_full()`. The test then triggers a fit transition (which drops the
// f32 graph), confirms the drop, and releases the paused request — which now
// observes `load_full() == None` and must exercise the retry path.
//
// We test BOTH `search` and `search_cofilter`, since both had the same
// transient-None defect.
