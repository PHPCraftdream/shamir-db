//! RV-INDEX-9F62C8DF — compaction cutover regression tests (T1–T8, T3b).
//!
//! Every schedule is FORCED, instance-scoped, and driven by the REAL paths
//! (`plan_insert` writers; `run_compaction_for_test` →
//! `run_background_compaction` coordinator). Synchronization is oneshot
//! PAIRs (fire hands the test the release SENDER; the writer/coordinator
//! parks until it is sent or dropped) — no sleeps, no yield loops, no
//! global statics. Every release sender handed to the test is wrapped in
//! [`ReleaseOnDrop`], so a parked writer/coordinator is released on EVERY
//! exit path (assertion panic included) and can never strand a test. Every
//! spawned task is `.await`-joined before its test returns.
//!
//! `tokio::time::timeout` appears ONLY as a hang detector / bounded
//! negative probe — never as synchronization. Each test documents its
//! revert-claim: the single production change whose revert makes it red.
