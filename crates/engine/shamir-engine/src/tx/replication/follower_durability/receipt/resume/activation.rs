//! Follower admission (S5c-X PR6b-3): the receipt protocol is the ONLY
//! follower apply protocol. `admit_follower` validates the durable follower
//! state at first follower admission and returns the admission verdict;
//! unsupported durable states (legacy bookmark formats, malformed records,
//! floor-without-bookmark evidence, conflicting seed-install state) are
//! REFUSED with typed errors — there is no "choose legacy" result anymore
//! and no migration: the operator reseeds the affected subscription.
//! `Fresh` means the caller must ADOPT (write the v3 baseline) before any
//! apply work.
//!
//! Refusal ordering: the durable-state refusal (legacy/malformed evidence) is
//! a property of the durable state — classification is read-only — and is
//! reported FIRST; the backend capability gate guards every verdict that
//! would allow follower work (Native/Fresh) before any adoption write or
//! allocation.
