//! Global byte-budget primitive — RI-15.
//!
//! `tokio::sync::Semaphore` counts *permits*, not bytes, and its permit
//! count is a `u32` — capping any byte-granular reuse of it at `u32::MAX`
//! and coupling byte accounting to permit accounting. [`ByteBudget`] is a
//! purpose-built async byte accountant: an `AtomicUsize` CAS-loop fast path
//! for acquire/release plus a [`tokio::sync::Notify`] to wake waiters when
//! bytes free up.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The server already clamps the size of any ONE batch response
//! (`security.query_limits.max_result_size_bytes`,
//! `crates/shamir-server/src/db_handler/handler.rs`), but nothing bounded
//! the SUM of in-flight response bytes across every concurrently-executing
//! batch/connection. At `max_active_connections = 1000` × a 64 MiB
//! per-batch cap, worst case is ~64 GiB of simultaneously buffered response
//! memory — unbounded relative to a typical 4–8 GiB container. `ByteBudget`
//! closes that gap: a single server-wide cap on in-flight response bytes.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! CR-B2: `ShamirDbHandler::execute` acquires a [`ByteBudgetGuard`] UPFRONT,
//! before the batch executes, using a pessimistic estimate — the batch's
//! (server-clamped) `max_result_size` — so the budget actually gates
//! EXECUTION-time memory, not just how long a serialized response sits on
//! the write path. Once the final `DbResponse` is known, the reservation is
//! narrowed down to the real serialized size via [`ByteBudgetGuard::shrink_to`]
//! (a bounded few-byte overshoot past the estimate is absorbed via
//! [`ByteBudgetGuard::grow_unchecked`] rather than a second blocking
//! acquire). The guard is threaded through
//! `connection::request_loop::WriterMsg::{Reply,ReplyAndClose}` and dropped
//! only after the writer task finishes the socket write (success or
//! error) — so the accounted (now-shrunk) bytes stay "reserved" for exactly
//! as long as they occupy memory on the write path, and the release always
//! happens on the writer task, never the dispatch task. The cursor path
//! (`db_handler::cursor_handlers::enforce_page_budget`) mirrors this same
//! upfront-reserve-then-shrink shape whenever a per-page size cap is
//! actively configured.
//!
//! # Fairness
//!
//! Waiters are NOT served strict FIFO. Every waiter wakes on every
//! `notify_waiters()` call (broadcast) and independently retries the CAS;
//! whichever wins the race proceeds, the rest re-park. This gives
//! **at-least-one-progress** per release (a release that frees enough
//! bytes for the head-of-line waiter is guaranteed to unblock SOMEONE, but
//! not necessarily in arrival order). Acceptable here: the budget is a
//! coarse OOM shield, not a scheduler — starvation would require a
//! continuous stream of large releases each claimed by a newer waiter,
//! which does not happen under the realistic workload (a fixed pool of
//! `max_active_connections` each issuing one batch at a time).
