//! Global cap on simultaneously-active connections.
//!
//! A simple atomic counter incremented at TCP-accept and decremented when
//! the per-connection task ends. RAII guard means we can't forget to
//! decrement on early exits (TLS handshake failure, slow-loris timeout,
//! handler panic — all clean up via Drop).
//!
//! Why **before** the TLS handshake: TLS itself costs ~5–10 ms of CPU per
//! connection. If the server is already at the cap, accepting a TCP
//! connection just to throw it away after the TLS work is wasteful and
//! plays into a DoS attacker's hand. We close the socket immediately
//! (TCP RST) and burn a single accept syscall instead.
//!
//! `try_acquire()` is non-blocking — it returns `None` rather than
//! waiting. The accept loop logs and drops the socket; the attacker's
//! retries see the same RST until the cap clears.

// ============================================================================
// Per-IP connection cap — companion to the global `ConnLimiter`.
//
// Audit §2a / top-5 #4: the global cap alone lets a SINGLE attacker IP
// occupy an unbounded fraction of `max_active_connections` (default 10000)
// with slow-loris sockets, starving every legitimate client. This limiter
// bounds the number of in-flight (pre-handshake + post-handshake)
// connections from one source IP.
//
// Design (per CLAUDE.md concurrency ideology):
//   * Backing store: `DashMap<IpAddr, AtomicUsize, THasher>` — sharded
//     locks, workspace-default `FxHasher`. NOT `std::sync::Mutex`.
//   * Counter is an `AtomicUsize` INSIDE the value. `try_acquire`'s CAS
//     retry loop reads/writes it through the `entry()` `RefMut` borrow,
//     so — despite an earlier version of this comment claiming
//     otherwise (F-2, #1077) — the shard's write lock IS held for the
//     ENTIRE `try_acquire` critical section, not released early. This
//     is deliberate, not an oversight: it fully serializes `try_acquire`
//     against `release()`'s `get_mut` + remove-if-zero on the SAME IP
//     (same shard key), closing the exact TOCTOU race #1073 found in
//     `CursorRegistry::register` (an outstanding `Arc<AtomicUsize>`
//     clone taken AFTER dropping the shard guard can race a concurrent
//     removal's "is it still zero" check, since a raw CAS on an escaped
//     Arc is invisible to the map's locking). A future perf pass that
//     wants to shrink this critical section MUST re-verify against that
//     exact race before dropping the guard early — see `try_acquire`'s
//     doc comment.
//   * RAII guard with `Drop` — same pattern as `ConnGuard`, so every
//     early-exit path (panic, TLS failure, timeout) releases automatically.
//   * Map-bounded: the guard's `Drop` removes the entry when the count
//     falls to 0, so the map doesn't grow unboundedly across distinct
//     historical IPs. (Removing under the shard lock is safe and cheap —
//     a concurrent `try_acquire` for the same IP that missed this entry
//     simply re-inserts it.)
